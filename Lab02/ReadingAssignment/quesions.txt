1, When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods (getters and setters) should only be used when necessary, and not as a default for all instance variables. Working with instance variables through accessor methods can lead to poor encapsulation, and makes it harder to change the implementation of the class without affecting clients. So instead of blindly creating accessor methods for all instance variables, developers should carefully consider which variables should be exposed, and which should be kept private. In general, accessor methods should only be created for instance variables that need to be read or modified by clients of the class.

2, If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
No, because Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods inside a class as long as they have different method signatures (constructor overloading) but in this case, since both the parameter for title and category have type "String" so there's no signature for these 2 constructors so that the compiler can not recognize them and return error.
